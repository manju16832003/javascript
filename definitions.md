# JavaScript Definitions

A function is a value representing an "action"

Ex:

```
function sayHi() {
    alert('Hello, Hi')
}
const func = sayHi; // sayHi is function value is assigned to func and later we could call it action on the function ex: func()

Regular values like strings or numbers represent the data.

A function can be perceived as an action.

We can pass it between variables and run when we want.
